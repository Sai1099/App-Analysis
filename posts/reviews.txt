Rahul Waghela,1,If I could give 0 stars, I would. They keep deducting charges for insufficient balance, even when I maintain the required balance in my account. It feels like they‚Äôre only focused on taking money from people. The app is also extremely slow and frustrating to use. There‚Äôs no option to pay missed EMIs, which makes things worse. If they can deduct money so easily, they should at least enable a feature for missed payments. Overall, this app is a total disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to any,September 5, 2024,129,Yes
Farhana Patel,1,This app is looting people's. Very poor response. I made EMI card with annual fees . Now they blocked my cards when I paid every EMI on time no any due.

I love bajaj app very much.,September 20, 2024,106,Yes
Nagaraj,1,If you don't know how to maintain a app, then why to bother create one? The app is so slow and not a single link works in the app, not the profile details, not the relations status, not the loan emi status, nothing.... Initially I thought it might be my network issue, but later I realised it's the app issue as other apps which uses internet works very well fine. So, kindly fix the issue ASAP.,September 13, 2024,75,Yes
Naqeeb Nasrulla Khan,1,The worst app ever, with extremely high charges and interest rates. I previously paid the EMI for the month of September 2024 a day before the due date, yet they are charging Rs. 2000. And I'm trying to connect with customer service to highlight the issue, but it's not connecting.,September 7, 2024,63,Yes
Sandeep Gavali,5,I have been using the Bajaj Finserv app for managing my loans and EMIs, and it has been an excellent experience. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate.

Overall, a fantastic app for financial management!",September 5, 2024,238,Yes
Animesh Khan,1,Very bad customer service. There is no way to clarify your doubts , there is no customer support no , virtual assistant is of no use .

Adabala. siva venkata sai,1,Worst App Ever! Avoid at All Costs Review: I've had an absolutely terrible experience with the Bajaj Finance app. The app is slow, buggy, and incredibly frustrating to use. I applied for a loan and a credit card, but there's been no response whatsoever. Even after my friend followed all the terms and conditions, the promised referral amount was never added to his account. I strongly advise anyone considering Bajaj Finance to think twice. This app is a complete waste of time and effort. There,September 7, 2024,53,Yes
Md Madina Sha Immi,1,Not recommended strongly,even though u have credit balance u can't even utilize it went to office requested to open block asking to wait for 4 months it's better to go some other platform it may give more opportunities with cibil but this people send msg every time once u open that u will get noting....waste of time n everything im withdrawing all of my company's cards better don't trust this app......,September 5, 2024,55,Yes
Abhinav Singh,1,App is good but services offered by Bajaj finance is worst. They provide loan beyond requirements and under cover they charges ANNUAL MAINTENANCE CHARGES every year for several years even you don't used that much amount. Moreover if you require to reduce your total withdrawal amount, they will not reduce becoz under cover of huge withdrawal amount they charges huge AMC. Never trust on this type of loan, they just want to grab your hard earned money in term of various charges.,September 21, 2024,5,Yes
Neeraj Lamba,1,These guys just scam on people by giving them an Insta Emi Card and later the card doesn't even work. They are looting people by getting a one time payment and annual fees from them. I tried using the card on Amazon and Flipkart but it was for nothing. When I reached out to them they told me that my credit score was too low. I don't think 700+ is a bad score. And even if it is, they should not have given me the card in the first place. Don't buy their cards!!!,September 17, 2024,18,Yes

Jyotiprakash Sahoo,1,Till last update everything was fine but after the last update the app is very slow and taking lots of internet and ram. Also app loading is very slow. Previously the interface was user friendly but not it's very hectic to find something out. Every time you will face problem while doing scan and pay. Can't pre pay your bills. Also the help and support is the worst. They will remove your ticket history without providing proper resolution. Thinking of uninstalling as there are better apps.,August 11, 2024,110,Yes
Gourav Saini,1,The rating of the app is misleading. This app is very slow and full of bugs. It doesn't load most of the details. I have taken a loan, it shows a blank screen when opening the loan details. I had to use the web portal to withdraw funds. It gets stuck every now and then, and requires a restart. I'm using the latest app version on a high-end device so its not a device issue.,July 11, 2024,496,Yes

mohit kaushik,1,This app is not right because this company forcibly gives loans. But when you need them, they have no customer support. The customer helpline number given, even after trying to contact for 10 days, you will not get any support. If even one of your installments gets bounced, how will you contact them? These people do not let you contact them, and then charge for the bounce and that too so much. Do not take loan from this app, it will be absolutely fine.,August 5, 2024,33,Yes

Sasikiran Pallapothu,1,Most hanging app, blanks out especially if you want to chat with customer care. Unnecessary UPI creations forcefully. Unexpected charges like FFR, etc Charges explained are different to that of debited. One tick box for everything disregard our requirement. Once jumped, they convert us as frogs in the well. Too much of ads and customer care is not responsible for anything. All this with recent loan process experiences.,July 11, 2024,22,Yes
Saifuddin Gani,1,Such hideous people working in the support group. They offered me some DBS card when I rejected it . They checked my CIBIL to leave a mark on purpose.
